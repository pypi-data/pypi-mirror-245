MARRMoT plugin for [eWatercycle](https://ewatercycle.readthedocs.io/).

MARRMoT documentation at https://github.com/wknoben/MARRMoT .

## Installation

eWaterCycle must be installed in a [mamba](https://conda-forge.org/miniforge/) environment. The environment can be created with

```console
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eWaterCycle/ewatercycle/main/environment.yml
mamba env create --name ewatercycle-marrmot --file environment.yml
conda activate ewatercycle-marrmot
```

Install this package alongside your eWaterCycle installation

```console
pip install ewatercycle-marrmot
```

Then MARRMoT models become available as eWaterCycle models

```python
from ewatercycle.models import MarrmotM01, MarrmotM14
```

## Usage
