# This file is for code related to applying master calibrations (dark, flats)
#   onto raw images

# Steps:
# 1. Compute average pixel value of the master flat using a square matrix
# 2. Using CALIBRATION = (AVERAGE_FLAT/MASTER_FLAT)*(RAW_IMAGE-MASTER_DARK)
#    Note: AVERAGE_FLAT is a value, MASTER_FLAT, RAW_IMAGE and MASTER_DARK are matrices.
# TODO:
#  Remove the hot pixels
#  Something to do with saving pixel values > 2 sigma in the IDL code ???

# getCenterAverage
#
# make a square center for the master flat-field frame (size is up to the user)
# and compute the average value of that square matrix
#
# 1024 x 1024 is cropped into 175x175 square box
# so 2048 x 2048 is cropped into 350 x 350 square box
# this is a square starting from (850, 850) to (1200, 1200)
