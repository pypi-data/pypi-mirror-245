== Making a release

NOTE: This is a work in progress

.Update dependencies

For developement and normal installation we rely on `pyproject.toml` with loose dependencies.
For docker images we rely on `requirements.txt` and `requirements-slim.txt` with strict dependencies.
It is important to keep both approaches in sync and to peridiocally update the requirements files (like before releases).
See https://github.com/GoSecure/pyrdp/pull/219[the PR where we improved our use of the docker cache] for the reasoning behind this approach.

In a clean tree, on master:

* install and load the venv
* do a `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
* manually inspect updated dependencies
* copy over to `requirements-slim.txt` those that make sense (don't add av, PySide2, etc.)

If you are unsure about which to keep and which to discard between `requirements.txt` and `requirements-slim.txt`, just look at a diff of a previous version.

.Test

docker images (latest, slim), on linux, on Windows

.Update the changelog
* You can generate author list with where `<tag>` is replaced with previous release's tag:
+
    git log <tag>.. --format="%aN" --reverse | perl -e 'my %dedupe; while (<STDIN>) { print unless $dedupe{$_}++}' | sort

.Prepare release commit
* Update version in `pyproject.toml`
* commit msg: Prepare %version% release
* You can optionally do a release commit (with `--allow-empty` if needed) msg: Release %version%

.Tag the release commit
* `git tag -a v%version%` like `git tag -a v1.0.0` (docker builds rely on this tag)
* Annotated Tag msg: Version %version%

.Push your changes (don't forget the tag!)

.Make a release on github (from changelog and copy sections themes from previous releases)
* linkify issues with vim's: `%s/{uri-issue}\d\+\[#\(\d\+\)\]/#\1/gc`
* sections, vim's: `%s/^=== \(.*\)$/## \1/gc`
* asciidoc links to markdown with vim: `%s/link:\([^\[]\+\)\(\[[^\[]\+\]\)/\2(\1)/gc`

.Upload binaries to PyPI

Instructions are partially from: https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/deliver-to-pypi/#manual-method

    rm -rf dist/
    # Make a source distribution
    pipx run build --sdist

* Download packages built (called artifacts) by the https://github.com/GoSecure/pyrdp/actions/workflows/wheels.yml[Build workflow on GitHub] that are from the release commit
* Extract the zip in the dist/ directory

    # Upload using 'twine'
    pipx run twine upload dist/*

.Post-release
* Update version in `pyproject.toml` (+1 bugfix, append '.dev0') and commit
* commit msg: Begin development on next release


== Logging

By default we log to stdout and in JSON format. Please use the recommended
logging style to best leverage the JSON output:
