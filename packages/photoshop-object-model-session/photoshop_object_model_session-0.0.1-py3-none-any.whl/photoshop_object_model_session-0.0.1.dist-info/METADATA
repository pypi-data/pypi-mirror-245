All classes have been written based on Photoshop's VBS documentation, which can be found at <https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/blob/master/Documentation/Product%20specific%20Documentation/Photoshop%20Scripting/photoshop-vbs-ref-2020.pdf>.
As such, the code you'll find here isn't very pythonic, because it is based on the Visual Basic syntax.
Please note that this package may contain inconsistencies, missing return types, and typos. Unfortunately, most of these issues stem from faithfully transcribing Adobes's flawed documentation.
