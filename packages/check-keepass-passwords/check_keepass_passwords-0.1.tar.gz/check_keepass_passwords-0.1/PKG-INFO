```

## Background

- The compromise check is powered by [https://github.com/lionheart/pwnedpasswords](pwnedpasswords). For implementation
  details and security notes, refer to their repository.
- Password scoring is powered by [zxcvbn](https://github.com/dwolfhub/zxcvbn-python), which rates passwords on a scale
  from 0 to 4. By default, `check-keepass-passwords` considers a score of 2 to be sufficiently safe. You can customize
  this threshold using the `--min-score` parameter.
