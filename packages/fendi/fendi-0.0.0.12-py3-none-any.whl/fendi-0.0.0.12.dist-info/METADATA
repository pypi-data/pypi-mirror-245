## Desclaimer
This project does not aim to cover best practices for Python project
development as a whole. For example, it does not provide guidance or tool
recommendations for version control, documentation, or testing.
Feel free to contact me directly, so that I can give you a walk through.

## Getting Started
**TL;DR**
> [Colab Tutorial]
> Just take a glimpse of this quick tutorial on Google Colab.
> [![Open In Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18Bw5EBs94M8c-iQob-WIS-KU8uyA9iJz#scrollTo=hqOdwn1sJZSx)

On
> Make sure that you virtual environment is activated.
1. Import Fendi in Your Python Script:
 ```py
from fendi import fedi
```
2. Define User Information:
 ```py
info = {
    "Pronoun": "his",
    "Subject": "he"}
```
Feel free to adapt this to your specific needs, adding or removing fields as required.

⚠️ The top required ones are :
``Pronoun``, ``Subject``, ``Name``, ``Full Name``, ``Intro and About`` .

3. Specify CV Path:
```py
 cv_path = r"./Profile.pdf"
```
Again the resume file should be downloaded from the Linkedin, see next section for more details.

4. Create Streamlit App:
> Invoke the create_app function provided by Fendi:
```python
 fedi.create_app(info, cv_path)
```
5. Run Your Streamlit App:
> Execute your Streamlit app script to launch the chatbot interface:
```python
streamlit run your_script.py
```
> ⚠️ ***Replace your_script.py with the name of your Python script.***   ️⚠️
6. Interact with the Chatbot:
Open your web browser and navigate to the provided Streamlit URL: http://localhost:8501/. Interact with the chatbot by
asking questions or providing input based on the user information.
7. Explore Example Usage:
Check out the `example.py` file
### Example Script
```python [exmple.py]
from fendi import fedi

def main():
    info = {
       # ... (your personal information)
    }
    cv_path = r"./Profile.pdf"
    fedi.create_app(info, cv_path)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

:warning: you should create a directory where you will put your script. It shall be this way:
```commandline
Directory Structure:
.
├── example.py
│   (Description: Your main Python script or example file.)
└── Profile.pdf
    (Description: The Resume file you downloaded from LinkedIn.)
```
