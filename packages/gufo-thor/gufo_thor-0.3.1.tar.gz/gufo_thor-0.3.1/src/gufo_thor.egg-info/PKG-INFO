Gufo Thor is a simple tool designed for quickly setting up and evaluating [NOC][NOC].
It's tailored for new NOC users who want to assess NOC's capabilities and NOC developers 
who need a fast development environment. Thor takes care of the complexity of NOC management, 
making the process straightforward.

## Installation

To install Thor, use pip:

```
pip install gufo-thor
```

## Quick NOC Setup

Create a directory where the services' configuration and data will be stored:

```
mkdir noc
cd noc
```

Start NOC with a simple command:

```
gufo-thor up
```

Access NOC at https://go.getnoc.com:32777/


To stop NOC:

```
gufo-thor stop
```

## Configuration

Thor's configuration is in the thor.yml file. You can use preconfigured defaults:

```
gufo-thor sample-config -t <name>
```

Where `<name>` can be:

* `simple` - Minimal setup with a web interface only.
* `common` - Setup with widely-used features for monitoring and network management.

The thor.yml structure:
```
# Gufo Thor configuration
version: "1.0"
noc:
  tag: master
  installation_name: Unconfigured Installation
expose:
  domain_name: go.getnoc.com
  port: 32777
services: [web, card]
```

Adapt the file to your needs and start NOC:

```
gufo-thor up
```

## On Gufo Stack

This product is a part of [Gufo Stack][Gufo Stack] - the collaborative effort 
led by [Gufo Labs][Gufo Labs]. Our goal is to create a robust and flexible 
set of tools to create network management software and automate 
routine administration tasks.

To do this, we extract the key technologies that have proven themselves 
in the [NOC][NOC] and bring them as separate packages. Then we work on API,
performance tuning, documentation, and testing. The [NOC][NOC] uses the final result
as the external dependencies.

[Gufo Stack][Gufo Stack] makes the [NOC][NOC] better, and this is our primary task. But other products
can benefit from [Gufo Stack][Gufo Stack] too. So we believe that our effort will make 
the other network management products better.
