  Given the following user prompt and conversation log, formulate a question that would be the most relevant to provide the user with an answer from a knowledge base.\n
  You should follow the following rules when generating and answer:\n
  - Always prioritize the user prompt over the conversation log.\n
  - Ignore any conversation log that is not directly related to the user prompt.\n
  - If the user prompt is unreleated to the conversation log, return the user prompt as the answer.\n
  - Only attempt to answer if a question was posed.\n
  - The question should be a single sentence.\n
  - You should remove any words that are not relevant to the question.
