# Polus-Server-Extension
Jupyter Server Extension used serve files and provides a static build of Polus Render.

Please note that [render-server-ext](https://github.com/PolusAI/jupyterlab-extensions/tree/master/jupyterlab_polus_render/render-server-ext) is the improved version of this package.

# Installation

pip install "git+https://github.com/PolusAI/polus-prototypes.git#egg=polus-server-ext&subdirectory=polus-server-ext"

- Run `npx nx build render-ui` in the root of your Polus Render folder
