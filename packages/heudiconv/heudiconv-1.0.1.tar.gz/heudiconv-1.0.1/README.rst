About
-----

``heudiconv`` is a flexible DICOM converter for organizing brain imaging data
into structured directory layouts.

- It allows flexible directory layouts and naming schemes through customizable heuristics implementations.
- It only converts the necessary DICOMs and ignores everything else in a directory.
- You can keep links to DICOM files in the participant layout.
- Using `dcm2niix <https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix/>`_ under the hood, it's fast.
- It can track the provenance of the conversion from DICOM to NIfTI in W3C PROV format.
- It provides assistance in converting to `BIDS <http://bids.neuroimaging.io/>`_.
- It integrates with `DataLad <https://www.datalad.org/>`_ to place converted and original data under git/git-annex
  version control while automatically annotating files with sensitive information (e.g., non-defaced anatomicals, etc).

Installation
------------

See our `installation page <https://heudiconv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_
on heudiconv.readthedocs.io .

HOWTO 101
---------

In a nutshell -- ``heudiconv`` operates using a heuristic which, given metadata from DICOMs, would decide how to name
resultant (from conversion using `dcm2niix`_) files. Heuristic `convertall <https://github
.com/nipy/heudiconv/blob/master/heudiconv/heuristics/convertall.py>`_ could actually be used with no real
heuristic and by simply establish your own conversion mapping through editing produced mapping files.
In most use-cases of retrospective study data conversion, you would need to create your custom heuristic following
`existing heuristics as examples <https://github.com/nipy/heudiconv/tree/master/heudiconv/heuristics>`_ and/or
referring to `"Heuristic" section <https://heudiconv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/heuristics.html>`_ in the documentation.
**Note** that `ReproIn heuristic <https://github.com/nipy/heudiconv/blob/master/heudiconv/heuristics/reproin.py>`_ is
generic and powerful enough to be adopted virtually for *any* study: For prospective studies, you would just need
to name your sequences following the `ReproIn convention <https://github.com/nipy/heudiconv/blob/master/heudiconv/heuristics/reproin.py#L26>`_, and for
retrospective conversions, you often would be able to create a new versatile heuristic by simply providing
remappings into ReproIn as shown in `this issue (documentation is coming) <https://github.com/ReproNim/reproin/issues/18#issuecomment-834598084>`_.

Having decided on a heuristic, you could use the command line::

    heudiconv -f HEURISTIC-FILE-OR-NAME -o OUTPUT-PATH --files INPUT-PATHs

with various additional options (see ``heudiconv --help`` or
`"Usage" in documentation <https://heudiconv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html>`__) to tune its behavior to
convert your data.

For detailed examples and guides, please check out `ReproIn conversion invocation examples <https://github.com/ReproNim/reproin/#conversion>`_
and the `user tutorials <https://heudiconv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html>`_ in the documentation.
