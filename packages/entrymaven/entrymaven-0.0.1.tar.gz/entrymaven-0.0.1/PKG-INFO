## Getting Started - Library

### Installation

```Python
pip install entrymaven
```

### Usage

Simple example of how to use:

```Python
import entrymaven as emav

emav.Essentials.gen()
l = emav.l

l.info('First entry in this log file')

# Output: 2000-01-01 00:00:00,000 - INFO - First entry in this log file
```

> **Note**: As default, the log file name is "entries.log" and the log level is DEBUG

An alternative, more concise approach that includes defining a custom log file name and log recording level:

```Python
from entrymaven import l, Essentials
Essentials.gen(filename= 'test.log', level= 'INFO')

l.info('First entry in this log file')
```
