# 2023-11-13: GHA macOS py3.12 will sometimes reject gen_utf8 filenames, e.g.,:
#   tests/test_fileboss.py:227: in simple_config_obj
#     with open(filepath, "w") as conf_file:
#   OSError: [Errno 92] Illegal byte sequence:
#     '/private/var/folders/3s/vfzpb5r/T/pytest-of-runner/pytest-0/
#      test_load_config_obj_fail_dupl0/ËÉÜÏûë„Ä≥ﬁñ„©ãË†åÏü≤ÂµÅòÄ¢ûÅó'
# - It failed this test most recently (and the first time):
#       def test_load_config_obj_fail_duplicate_error
#   - Though it passed when I re-ran the test (sorta as I expected).
# - TRACK/2023-11-13 01:29: This was the first time I've seen this failure.
#   - Keep an eye on it... maybe there's a filename-safe gen_utf8 generator.
# - One suggestion:
#       filename = unicodedata.normalize(
#           'NFC', unicode(filename, 'utf-8')
#       ).encode('utf-8')
#   except that snipped is from 2012, and what's unicode()?
# - REFER: "MacOS X uses a special kind of decomposed UTF-8 to store filenames."
