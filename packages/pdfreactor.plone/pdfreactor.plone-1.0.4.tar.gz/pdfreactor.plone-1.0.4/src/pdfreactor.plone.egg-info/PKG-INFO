        ================
        pdfreactor.plone
        ================
        
        This Add-On package integrates the PDFreactor_ client API by RealObjects_,
        as provided by the pdfreactor-api_ package, into Plone.
        
        To effectively make use of it, you'll need
        
        - a running *PDFreactor* server
        - the keys needed to access it;
          depending on the server configuration:
        
          - the license key (from *RealObjects*; see https://www.pdfreactor.com/buy/)
            (unless installed on the server)
        
            and
          - an API key, if required by the server.
        
        
        Features
        ========
        
        - A simple ``@@as.pdf`` browser view for contentish objects
          (providing a synchronous PDF export with standard options)
        - A custom form ``@@pdfreactor-connection-settings`` to edit the
          *connection* settings (which are stored in the Plone registry)
        - A simple ``@@pdfreactor-config`` view to provide basic *conversion* settings
          (i.e., the Zope cookies which are needed to create PDF exports from
          restricted contents)
        
          For a package providing customizable conversion settings in the registry as
          well, see below.
        
        - A simple CSS stylesheet which is used by the default configuration to
          suppress uninteresting page parts
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Plone environments are typically built using `zc.buildout`_;
        so add to your ``buildout.cfg`` script::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                pdfreactor.plone
        
        and then run ``bin/buildout``.
        
        This will get you the pdfreactor-api_ package as well.
        
        After restarting your Zope instance, you'll find the package in
        the Quick-Installer or
        the Plone Add-Ons view.
        
        After installing (or *activating*) the package there,
        visit the ``@@pdfreactor-connection-settings`` `view of your Plone instance`_
        to customize your PDFreactor connection settings
        (URL and license and / or API key).
        
        For installation instructions regarding the PDFreactor service itself, please
        refer to `PDFreactor Support`_.
        
        
        Customization
        =============
        
        Zope / Plone
        ------------
        
        You have several options:
        
        - You may subclass our .base.Exporter BrowserView class
          (which provides the ``@@as.pdf`` view)
          and override some of it's methods,
          e.g.
        
          - converted_url
          - conversionSettings
        
        - You may connect our BrowserView class or subclasses of it
          to more specific interfaces than IContentish.
          (You might need a layer interface to avoid configuration conflicts).
        
        - You may override the ``@@pdfreactor-config`` view to modify the conversion
          options (generally, or by interface).
        
          One add-on package to get a global "TTW" customizable configuration is
          pdfreactor.parsecfg_.
        
        Please refer to the Zope / Plone documentation for instructions how to do this.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        
        1.0.4 (2023-12-08)
        ------------------
        
        Miscellaneous:
        
        - Add ``__noduplicate`` to the list of cookies.
        
          This is important if you use the ``no_duplicate_login`` PAS plugin
          (Products.NoDuplicateLogin_);
          otherwise, creation of PDF documents or screenshots might fail.
          Or the PDFreactor might kick you out.

        1.0.3 (2023-04-05)
        ------------------
        
        New Features:
        
        - The .base.Exporter class now provides an own `.convert` method
          which accepts `binary`, `async` and `stream` arguments
          and calls the appropriate conversion method internally.
        
          Currently, it will return
        
          - `None`, if a `stream` was given,
          - binary data, if `binary` was given (and not `stream`), and
          - the document_id, if `async` was given, and
          - a `dict` with all meta information contained otherwise.
        
        Improvements:
        
        - The .base.Exporter class now provides (and uses) a `conversionSource`
          method which in turn uses the existing `converted_url` method.
        
          **Note:** if providing text instead of a URL as the ``document`` config key,
          you likely need to specify a ``baseUrl`` as well; otherwise the reactor
          might fail to load stylesheets or images during conversion.
        
        Development hints:
        
        - When developing and testing your PDFreactor_ conversions,
          be sure you have more than one Zope worker thread ready;
          otherwise you might wonder about HTTP errors
          when the reactor sends requests to your instance!
        
        - We provide the original API (from the PDFreactor_ distribution) as `.raw_api`
          module (for development and testing;
          helps to check whether a certain problem
          is related to our pythonization measures).
        
          Just in case.

        1.0.2 (2023-01-20)
        ------------------
        
        New Features:
        
        - For `MathML` support:
         
          - added a `@@pdfreactor-mathjax-vars.js` view (for configuration),
            and 
          - a ``++resource++pdfreactor.plone/mathjax2-run.js``
            script to ease MathJax_ integration.
        
          This is not configurable yet, but will likely be, soon.
        
          **Note:** `PDFreactor v11.6.3`_ (2023-03-07) contains a fix
          to a bug which caused `MathML` exports as "continuous media" to fail.
        
        - The @@as.pdf method supports a `method` option; e.g., call
          ``.../my/page/@@as.pdf?method=@@from-screenshot`` to create a PDF file from
          ``.../my/page/@@from-screenshot``.
        
        [tobiasherp]
        
        
        1.0.1 (2022-09-20)
        ------------------
        
        Miscellaneous:
        
        - The `connectionSettings` method doesn't return any cookies anymore
          because the Zope cookies are considered `config` information.
        - The .base.Exporter provides a `getZopeCookies` method now
          for use in derived view classes which override the `conversionSettings`
          method to not use @@pdfreactor-config.

        1.0.0 (2022-07-12)

        - Initial release.
