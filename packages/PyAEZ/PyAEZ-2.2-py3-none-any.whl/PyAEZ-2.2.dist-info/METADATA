# PyAEZ

PyAEZ is a python package consisted of many algorithms related to Agro-ecalogical zoning (AEZ) framework. PyAEZ tries to encapsulate all complex calculations in AEZ and try to provide user friendly, and intuitive ways to input data and output results after calculations.

# Installation

Now the package can be installed using `pip` command as below,

```shell
pip install pyaez==2.1
```

Alternatively, can be installed using using `conda` command as below,

```shell
conda install -c conda-forge pyaez
```

### Introduction

PyAEZ includes 6 main modules as below. Additionally to that, UtilityCalculations module is also included in PyAEZ to perform additional related utility calculations.

- Module I: Climate Regime
- Module II: Crop Simulations
- Module III: Climate Constraints
- Module IV: Soil Constraints
- Module V: Terrain Constraints
- Module VI: Economic Suitability Analysis
- UtilityCalculations Module

Other than 6 main modules and utility module, following 3 major algorithms related to AEZ also are included in PyAEZ. Those 3 major algorithms can be utilized individually without running whole PyAEZ.

- Biomass Calculations
- Evapotranspiration Calculations
- CropWat Calculations

### Dependencies

- numpy
- scipy
- gdal
- numba 

### Step-by-step Process

Following 6 Jupyter notebooks in the GitHub repository can be used as worked full example for PyAEZ 6 major modules.

- NB1_ClimateRegime.ipynb
- NB2_CropSimulation.ipynb
- NB3_ClimaticConstraints.ipynb
- NB4_SoilConstraints.ipynb
- NB5_TerrainConstraints.ipynb
- NB6_EconomicSuitability.ipynb

**Note**: _NB2_CropSimulation.ipynb_ takes a huge amount of time due to automatic crop calendar calculations. Hence, we have rewritten core parts of PyAEZ (_CropWatCalc.py_, _BioMassCalc.py_ and _ETOCalc.py_) with [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/) compatible manner as well. Numba translates Python functions to optimized machine code at runtime, allowing calculation speeds close to C or FORTRAN.

### Release Note PyAEZv2.1
The goal of this release is to improve the overall accuracy and reliability of the AEZ methodology in Module 1, 2, and 3. The key updates are as follows:

**Module 1**:
- Major improvements in the Length of Growing Period (LGP) calculation routine through the implementation of Numba (a Python package to speed up the calculation) and cross-checking the methodology with the Global AEZ from IIASA. 
- All the climatic indicators had been thoroughly cross-checked and verified with the Global AEZ outputs. 

**Module 2**:
- Reading crop/crop cycle parameters from excel sheet.
- Updated algorithm for TSUM screening and parameter settings.
- New thermal screening logics: permafrost screening, crop-specific rule screening.
- Updated algorithm for perennial crop simulations.
- New outputs: thermal reduction factor maps (fc1), yield reduction due to moisture deficit (fc2) and optimum starting date, for both rainfed and irrigated conditions.

**Module 3**:
- New look-up table setting for agro-climatic reduction factors for both rainfed and irrigated conditions.
- Updated algorithm related to agro-climatic constraints calculation.
- New outputs: Adjusted Length of Growing Period for agro-climatic constraints, agro-climatic constraint map (fc3).
