This is the default distribution if `pixel_indices` is None and a MPI communicator is provided, given that the `libsharp` package is importable:\n",

The configuration of `MapDistribution` is the same as before, when `libsharp` is not importable. In this case the pixels are distributed uniformly across the processes.\n",
