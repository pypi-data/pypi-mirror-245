# KerasNLP: Modular NLP Workflows for Keras

KerasNLP is a natural language processing library that works natively
with TensorFlow, JAX, or PyTorch. Built on Keras 3, these models, layers,
metrics, and tokenizers can be trained and serialized in any framework and
re-used in another without costly migrations.

KerasNLP supports users through their entire development cycle. Our workflows 
are built from modular components that have state-of-the-art preset weights and 
architectures when used out-of-the-box and are easily customizable when more 
control is needed.

This library is an extension of the core Keras API; all high-level modules are 
[`Layers`](https://keras.io/api/layers/) or 
[`Models`](https://keras.io/api/models/) that receive that same level of polish 
as core Keras. If you are familiar with Keras, congratulations! You already 
understand most of KerasNLP.

See our [Getting Started guide](https://keras.io/guides/keras_nlp/getting_started) 
for example usage of our modular API starting with evaluating pretrained models 
and building up to designing a novel transformer architecture and training a 
tokenizer from scratch.  

We are a new and growing project and welcome [contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Installation

KerasNLP supports both Keras 2 and Keras 3. We recommend Keras 3 for all new
users, as it enables using KerasNLP models and layers with JAX, TensorFlow and
PyTorch.

### Keras 2 Installation

To install the latest KerasNLP release with Keras 2, simply run:

```
pip install --upgrade keras-nlp
```

### Keras 3 Installation

There are currently two ways to install Keras 3 with KerasNLP. To install the
stable versions of KerasNLP and Keras 3, you should install Keras 3 **after**
installing KerasNLP. This is a temporary step while TensorFlow is pinned to
Keras 2, and will no longer be necessary after TensorFlow 2.16.

```
pip install --upgrade keras-nlp
pip install --upgrade keras>=3
```
## Using KerasNLP with Keras Core

As of version `0.6.0`, KerasNLP supports multiple backends with Keras Core out 
of the box. There are two ways to configure KerasNLP to run with multi-backend 
support:

1. Via the `KERAS_BACKEND` environment variable. If set, then KerasNLP will be 
using Keras Core with the backend specified (e.g., `KERAS_BACKEND=jax`).
2. Via the `.keras/keras.json` and `.keras/keras_nlp.json` config files (which 
are automatically created the first time you import KerasNLP):
   - Set your backend of choice in `.keras/keras.json`; e.g., `"backend": "jax"`. 
   - Set `"multi_backend": True` in `.keras/keras_nlp.json`.

Once that configuration step is done, you can just import KerasNLP and start 
using it on top of your backend of choice:

```python
import keras_nlp

gpt2_lm = keras_nlp.models.GPT2CausalLM.from_preset("gpt2_base_en")
gpt2_lm.generate("My trip to Yosemite was", max_length=200)
```

Until Keras Core is officially released as Keras 3.0, KerasNLP will use 
`tf.keras` as the default backend. To restore this default behavior, simply 
`unset KERAS_BACKEND` and ensure that  `"multi_backend": False` or is unset in 
`.keras/keras_nlp.json`. You will need to restart the Python runtime for changes 
to take effect.

To install the latest nightly changes for both KerasNLP and Keras, you can use
our nightly package.

```
pip install --upgrade keras-nlp-nightly
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Keras 3 will not function with TensorFlow 2.14 or earlier.

Read [Getting started with Keras](https://keras.io/getting_started/) for more information
on installing Keras 3 and compatibility with different frameworks.

## Quickstart

Fine-tune BERT on a small sentiment analysis task using the 
[`keras_nlp.models`](https://keras.io/api/keras_nlp/models/) API:

```python
import os
os.environ["KERAS_BACKEND"] = "tensorflow"  # Or "jax" or "torch"!

import keras_nlp
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds

imdb_train, imdb_test = tfds.load(
    "imdb_reviews",
    split=["train", "test"],
    as_supervised=True,
    batch_size=16,
)
# Load a BERT model.
classifier = keras_nlp.models.BertClassifier.from_preset(
    "bert_base_en_uncased", 
    num_classes=2,
)
# Fine-tune on IMDb movie reviews.
classifier.fit(imdb_train, validation_data=imdb_test)
# Predict two new examples.
classifier.predict(["What an amazing movie!", "A total waste of my time."])
```

For more in depth guides and examples, visit https://keras.io/keras_nlp/.

## Configuring your backend

If you have Keras 3 installed in your environment (see installation above),
you can use KerasNLP with any of JAX, TensorFlow and PyTorch. To do so, set the
`KERAS_BACKEND` environment variable. For example:

```shell
export KERAS_BACKEND=jax
```

Or in Colab, with:

```python
import os
os.environ["KERAS_BACKEND"] = "jax"

import keras_nlp
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to set the `KERAS_BACKEND` before import any Keras libraries, it
> will be used to set up Keras when it is first imported.

## Compatibility

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), and plan to
provide backwards compatibility guarantees both for code and saved models built
with our components. While we continue with pre-release `0.y.z` development, we
may break compatibility at any time and APIs should not be consider stable.

## Disclaimer

KerasNLP provides access to pre-trained models via the `keras_nlp.models` API.
These pre-trained models are provided on an "as is" basis, without warranties
or conditions of any kind. The following underlying models are provided by third
parties, and subject to separate licenses:
BART, DeBERTa, DistilBERT, GPT-2, OPT, RoBERTa, Whisper, and XLM-RoBERTa.
