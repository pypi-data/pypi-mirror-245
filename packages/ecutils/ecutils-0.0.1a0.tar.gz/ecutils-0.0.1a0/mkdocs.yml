site_description: >-
  A comprehensive Python library for elliptic curve operations, providing utilities
  for common tasks such as digital signature generation and verification (ECDSA),
  key exchange protocols (ECDH and Massey-Omura), message encoding onto elliptic
  curves (Koblitz) as well as various elliptic curve operations. It is designed to be
  easy-to-use for cryptographic purposes and to facilitate the harnessing of
  elliptic curve cryptography for security applications.
