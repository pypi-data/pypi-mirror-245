 # Small and Mighty Conversational Agent Framework

This is an experimental project to develop next generation of conversational
agents that can connect the world of unconstrained generation of Large Language
Models (LLM) to the world of structured data sources. Our goal is to build a
modular and configurable framework to seamlessly integrate language agents with 
data sources to build conversational experiences for next generation of digital
systems.

> THIS PROJECT IS IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT. PROCEED WITH CAUTION!

## The Big Idea about Small Things

To achieve our goals, we are pursuing two fundamental ideas:
1. _Sequence to structure: Convert sequence to sequence models to sequence to 
structure extraction ones._
This is about extracting the structure of information required to properly
fulfill a user request from her natural language utterances.
2. Structure Informed Generation: Generate responses that combine both
unstructured and structured information.
