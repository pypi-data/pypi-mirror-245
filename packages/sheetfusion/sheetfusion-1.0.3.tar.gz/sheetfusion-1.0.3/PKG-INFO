## Description

SheetFusion is a simple, user-friendly tool designed to merge cover sheets with document files, primarily for academic and professional use. It automates the creation of personalized PDFs by combining individual cover pages with a standard document, such as exams or reports. This straightforward software offers a practical solution for those needing to distribute customized documents efficiently. It is written in Python and uses the [PyPDF3](https://github.com/sfneal/PyPDF3) library. It was created to merge cover sheets with exams. That is why the arguments are named as they are. However, it can be used to merge any PDF file with any other PDF file.
