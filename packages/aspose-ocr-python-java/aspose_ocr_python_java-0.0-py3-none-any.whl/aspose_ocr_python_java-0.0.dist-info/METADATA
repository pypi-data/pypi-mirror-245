# Aspose.OCR for Python via .NET library

Aspose.OCR for Python is a robust optical character recognition API. 
Developers can easily add OCR functionalities in their applications. 
API is extensible, easy to use, compact and provides a simple set of classes 
for controlling character recognition.

## Aspose OCR API
**Note: all methods in Aspose.OCR namespace**

Method | Description
------------- | -------------
*AsposeOCR()* | Constructor. Create api instance.
*recognize(images)* | Recognizing image with automatic detection of text 
*recognize(images, settings)* | Recognizing image with automatic detection of text 
*recognize_lines(images)* | Recognizing line
*recognize_lines(images, settings)* | Recognizing line
*detect_rectangles(images)* | 
*detect_rectangles(images, areas_type, detect_areas)* | 
*image_has_text(full_path, text, settings, ignore_case)* | 
*compare_image_texts(full_path1, full_path2, settings, ignore_case)* | 
*image_text_diff(full_path1, full_path2, settings, ignore_case)* | 
*calculate_skew(images)* | Calculates the skew angle in deg
*ImageProcessing.save(images, folder_path)* | Save preprocessed images to file system
*ImageProcessing.render(images)* | Save preprocessed images to Stream
*License()* | Constructor
*set_license(license_name)* | licenseName - path to xml license file.
*set_license(stream)* | 
*Logging.logging_level* | 
*OcrInput(type, filters)* | Object with images and preprocessing filters. Support for GIF, PNG, JPEG, BMP, TIFF, PDF, DJVU, Stream, byte array, base64, URI and WBMP.
*OcrInput(type)* | Object with images. Support for GIF, PNG, JPEG, BMP, TIFF, PDF, DJVU, Stream, byte array, base64, URI and WBMP.
*RecognitionResult* | result from recognize.
*RecognitionSettings* | settings for recognize.
*RectangleOutput* | result from detect_rectangles
*SkewOutput* | result from calculate_skew.


### Changes in the release 23.4.0
- start from scratch



# HOW TO BUILD THE LIBRARY
- build the Aspose.OCR for .NET NUGET package with env variable (config) - PYTHON=true and new version (not existed in NUGET
- put the package to local repository C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\NuGetPackages
- run the generate.bat script
- run the build.bat script
- Python release will be in the ..\CodePorting.Wrapper.Cs2Python\Aspose.OCR\out\ocr\python\upload.win folder
