**Sy**music("**Sy**bolic **Music**") is a cross platform `note level` midi decoding libaray with lightening speed, which is over 100 times faster than [mido](https://github.com/mido/mido), the main midi parsing library in python.

The libaray is written in cpp and based on [minimidi](https://github.com/lzqlzzq/minimidi/tree/main). It offers a python binding using pybind11.

Here, we have added a tutorial.ipynb for you to learn about how to use the libaray.

## Features

* You can just read a midi file like `score = symusic.Score("path to midi", time_unit="tick")`
* Multiple `time unit` is now supported (currently `tick` and `quarter`)
* The tempo attribute in the tempo event represents quarter per minute (qpm)
* We offer some batch operation functions for both `Score` and `Track` class:
  * shift_pitch(offset: int)
  * shift_velocity(offset: int)
  * shift_time(offset: float)
  * sort(key, reversse)
* You can operate each note just like you did before in python (like PrettyMidi)


## TODO

Notice that this libaray is under development:

* Writing back to midi files is currently not supported

## Installation
### Use pre-compiled version
```bash
pip install symusic
```

### Build from source
> Make sure that your system has cmake and c++ compilers

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Yikai-Liao/symusic
pip install ./symusic
```

## Benchmark
### Parsing MIDI

* test using [mahler.mid](https://github.com/lzqlzzq/minimidi/blob/main/example/mahler.mid) from minimidi/example in colab
* `mido` is writen in pure python, and only parses midi files to `event level`
* `pretty_midi` and `miditoolkit` is based on `mido`, and parse midi files to `note level`
