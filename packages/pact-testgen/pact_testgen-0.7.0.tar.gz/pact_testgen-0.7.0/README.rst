Generate Python test cases from Pact files, for easier provider verification.


* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://pact-testgen.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

* Test Pact contracts against your Python providers via unit tests. Get test isolation *for free*.
* ``pact-testgen`` creates test cases from your Pact files, with placeholders for defining provider states.


Getting Started
---------------

Install with pip
****************

::

    python -m pip install pact-testgen

Generate test files
*******************

Generate a ``provider_states.py`` and ``test_pact.py`` files in your tests directory:

::

    pact-testgen /tests/dir -f /path/to/pactfile.json

For more details, see the Usage_ section of the documentation.

Fill in the generated provider states file
******************************************

In your tests directory (passed as the first argument to ``pact-testgen``), you'll see a file named ``provider_states.py``. It will contain set up
functions matching the provider states defined in your pact file.

Before continuing, complete these functions so that they create the required states.

Run your tests
**************

Run your test suite as normal, being sure to check the the test runner has picked up
your new `test_pact.py` file.
