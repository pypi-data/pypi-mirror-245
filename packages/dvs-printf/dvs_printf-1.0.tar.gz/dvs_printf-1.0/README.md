# dvs_printf 
This function makes your python project looks good,
by using printf's styl animetion function you can print you stream in uniq styles 

#### printf function keywords
``` python
from dvs_printf import printf

printf(*values, styl='typing', speed=3, intervel=2, stay=True)
```


## values
values stream can be anythin like
`(string, int, float, list, set, tuple, dict)`
and you can give multiple input as any-data-type

```  python              
printf(str, list, [tuple, set], dict, int,...) 
```     


## styl
styl is different types of print animetion
each style type works differently according to description below

``` python
 ["typing", "headline", "mid", "f2b", "b2f", "gunshort", 
  "sniper", "metrix", "metrix2", "firing", "help"]
``` 

|  option  |                 description                |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------|
| typing   | print like typing                          |
| headline | print like head lines in news              |
| mid      | print line from mid                        |
| f2b      | remove word from (back to front)           |
| b2f      | remove word from (front to back)           |
| gunshort | firing the words from short gun            |
| sniper   | sniping the words from end of the terminal |
| metrix   | print random words to real line            |
| metrix2  | print 1st word and 2nd random word         |
| firing   | just look like firing (Just For Fun)       |


## speed
Speed is printf's animetion speed, `defult speed is 3`
you can set `speed from ( 1 to 6 )`
```
1 = Very Slow
2 = Slow
3 = Mediam
4 = Mediam Fast
5 = Fast
6 = Very Fast
```

``` python
printf("hello world", speed=2)
```


## intervel
intervel is waiting time between printing 
of two lines (intervel in second) <br>
`defult intervel is 2`, 
you can set intervel from `0 to 10 or greater` 

``` python
printf("hello world", "hii I am coder", intervel=2)

>>> hello world
(Then wating time of intervel time in second)
>>> hii I am coder
```


## stay
stay decides after styl animetion whether you want the `stream OR Not`. <br>
stay can be True or False, `(defult stay = True)`. <br>
if you want to remove printed line. you can set `stay=False`. <br>
So, After styl amimetion and intervel time printed Line can be removes.<br><br>
but some styles `take No action on stay`,
whether it is `True OR False`. it works as it should be.

Ex. `(typing, f2b, b2f, metrix, metrix2)`

``` python 
printf("hello world", styl="headline", stay=True)
```

# listfunction

***
``` python
listfunction(*values: any, getMet: bool | None=False) -> list
```

An additionl function which is used by printf function 

listfunction( ) takes `Any DataType` in input and return a new list.
created by input values & it break deta sets by index and add them into 
new list then return that list.



### getMet
`detult getMet = False` <br>
if metrix is given, set `getMet=True`, 
it breaks metix in `rows by index` and convet that in to string.
