# IFSC Search

IFSC Search is a Python module that facilitates searching for bank details using the Indian Financial System Code (IFSC). The module fetches data from the Razorpay IFSC API.

## Installation

You can install the module using pip:

```bash
pip install ifscSearch
```

## Usage

Here is an example of how to use the `ifsc-search` module in your Python script:

```python
from ifsc_search import get_details

# Replace "PYTM0123456" with the IFSC code you want to search
ifsc_code_to_search = "PYTM0123456"
result = get_details(ifsc_code_to_search)

if result:
    print(f"Details for IFSC code {ifsc_code_to_search}:\n{result}")
else:
    print(f"IFSC code {ifsc_code_to_search} not found in the Razorpay IFSC database.")
```

Replace `"PYTM0123456"` with the actual IFSC code you want to search. The `get_details` function fetches information from the Razorpay IFSC API, and the result is printed. The expected output will either display the details for the given IFSC code or indicate that the code was not found.
