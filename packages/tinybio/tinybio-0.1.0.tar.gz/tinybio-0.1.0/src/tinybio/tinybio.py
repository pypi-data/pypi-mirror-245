    Data structure for maintaining the information associated with a node
    and performing node operations.

    Suppose that a workflows is supported by three nodes (parties performing
    the decentralized registration and authentication functions). The :obj:`node`
    objects would be instantiated locally by each of these three parties.

    >>> nodes = [node(), node(), node()]

    The preprocessing phase that the nodes must execute can be simulated using
    the :obj:`preprocess` function. It is assumed that biometric descriptors
    used for registration and authentication are represented as lists of
    :obj:`float` values. All such descriptors must be of the same length,
    and this length must be supplied as the second argument to the
    :obj:`preprocess` function.

    >>> preprocess(nodes, length=4)

    It is then possible for a client to register itself by obtaining
    a registration :obj:`token`. Suppose the client has a biometric
    descriptor represented as a vector of floating point values. The
    client can create a :obj:`request` for masks using the
    :obj:`request.registration` method.

    >>> reg_descriptor = [0.5, 0.3, 0.7, 0.1]
    >>> reg_request = request.registration(reg_descriptor)

    The client can deliver the request to each node, at which point that node
    can locally use its :obj:`~tinynmc.tinynmc.node.masks` method (inherited
    from the :obj:`tinynmc.tinynmc.node` class) to generate masks that can
    be returned to the requesting client.

    >>> reg_masks = [node.masks(reg_request) for node in nodes]

    The client can then generate locally a registration :obj:`token` (*i.e.*, a
    masked descriptor) via the :obj:`token.registration` method.

    >>> reg_token = token.registration(reg_masks, reg_descriptor)

    At any later point, it is possible to perform an authentication workflow.
    Masks for the authentication descriptor can be requested via a process
    that parallels the one for registration (in this case using the
    :obj:`request.authentication` method).

    >>> auth_descriptor = [0.1, 0.4, 0.8, 0.2]
    >>> auth_request = request.authentication(auth_descriptor)
    >>> auth_masks = [node.masks(auth_request) for node in nodes]

    Given the masks for the authentication descriptor, the authentication
    :obj:`token` (*i.e.*, a masked descriptor) can be generated locally by
    the client via the :obj:`token.authentication` method.

    >>> auth_token = token.authentication(auth_masks, auth_descriptor)

    Finally, the client can broadcast its original registration token together
    with its authentication token. Each node can then compute locally its share of
    the authentication result. These shares can be reconstructed by the validating
    party using the :obj:`reveal` function to obtain the Euclidean distance
    between the registration and authentication descriptors.

    >>> shares = [node.authenticate(reg_token, auth_token) for node in nodes]
    >>> result = reveal(shares)

    The tests below confirm that the computed result is indeed the Euclidean
    distance.

    >>> abs(result - 0.43) <= 0.05 # Use comparison for floating point value.
    True
    >>> abs(result - math.sqrt(sum(
    ...     (x - y) ** 2 
    ...     for (x, y) in zip(reg_descriptor, auth_descriptor)
    ... ))) <= 0.05
