"""
This module is a singleton that provides the data from Conductor endpoints. Specifically, it provides projects, instance types, and software package data. It is also possible to use cached fixture data for development purposes.

Since the data is stored at the module level, you can access it from anywhere in your code without the need to pass it around.

    Raises:
        ValueError:  Module was not initialized with [init()](/data/#ciocore.data.init).

    Returns:
        dict: Keys are `projects`, `instance_types`, `software`.

    When you access the data, if it has already been fetched, it will be returned. Otherwise,
    requests will be made to fetch the data. You may need to authenticate in order to access the
    data.

    The set of instance types and software can be pruned to match the available platforms
    represented by each other. For example, if the instance types come from an orchestrator that
    provides both Windows and Linux machines, and the software product(s) are available on both
    platforms, no pruning occurs. However, if there are no Windows machines available, any Windows
    software will be removed from the package tree. Similarly, if a product is chosen that only runs
    on Windows, Linux instance types will not appearin the list of available hardware.

    Here is a breakdown of each key in the dictionary:

    * **projects** is a list of project names for your authenticated account.

    * **instance_types** is an instance of HardwareSet, providing you with access to the list of
    available machines configurations.

    * **software** is a PackageTree object containing either all
    the software available at Conductor, or a subset based on specified products.

        >>> coredata.init(product="maya-io")
