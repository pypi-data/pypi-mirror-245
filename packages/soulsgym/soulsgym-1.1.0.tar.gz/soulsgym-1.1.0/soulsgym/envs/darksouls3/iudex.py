"""The SoulsGym environment for Iudex Gundyr.

The player and Iudex always start from their respective start poses at full HP/SP. A fall from
the cliff is considered an instantaneous death and is eagerly reset to avoid falling out of the
world. The player starts with the knight base stats and the default starting weapons without any
upgrades. We do not allow shield blocking or two handing at this point, although this can easily
be supported. Parrying is enabled.

Note:
    Phase 2 of the boss fight is available by setting the environment keyword argument ``phase``.
    See :mod:`~.envs` for details.
