## 🐍 **pyaging**: a Python-based compendium of GPU-optimized aging clocks

`pyaging` is a cutting-edge Python package designed for the longevity research community, offering a comprehensive suite of GPU-optimized biological aging clocks.

[Installation](https://pyaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) - [Search, cite, and get metadata](https://pyaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_utils.html) - [Bulk DNA methylation](https://pyaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_dnam.html) - [Bulk histone mark ChIP-Seq](https://pyaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_histonemarkchipseq.html) - [Bulk ATAC-Seq](https://pyaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_atacseq.html) - [Bulk RNA-Seq](https://pyaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_rnaseq.html) - [API Reference](https://pyaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyaging.html)

With a growing number of aging clocks, comparing and analyzing them can be challenging. `pyaging` simplifies this process, allowing researchers to input various molecular layers (DNA methylation, histone ChIP-Seq, ATAC-seq, transcriptomics, etc.) and quickly analyze them using multiple aging clocks, thanks to its GPU-backed infrastructure. This makes it an ideal tool for large datasets and multi-layered analysis.

## 📝 To-Do List

- [X] Integrate `black` for PEP8 compliant code formatting
- [X] Improve and expand `readthedocs` documentation
- [X] Add option to specify download directory for datasets
- [X] Rename datasets to reflect source publications
- [X] Include mammalian array example datasets
- [X] Add feature to control logging verbosity
- [X] Publish to PyPi
- [X] Add percentage of missing features in anndata after age prediction for each clock
- [X] Add and populate "Notes" tab in metadata
- [X] Add PhenoAge based on blood chemistry analysis (and datasets)
- [X] Add table in readthedocs with all clock metadata 
- [ ] Integrate scAge and scRNAseq clocks (and datasets)
- [ ] Incorporate murine DNA methylation and proteomic clocks (and datasets)

## ⚙️ Current update pipeline

For version update:

- [ ] Update package version in pyproject.toml
- [ ] Update package version in docs/source/conf.py
- [ ] `poetry update`
- [ ] `poetry build`
- [ ] `poetry run pytest --nbmake tutorials/`
- [ ] `make html` in docs folder
- [ ] `git add .`
- [ ] `git commit -m "commit message"`
- [ ] `git push`
- [ ] `git tag -a vX.X.X -m "release message"`
- [ ] `git push origin vX.X.X`

For adding a new clock:
