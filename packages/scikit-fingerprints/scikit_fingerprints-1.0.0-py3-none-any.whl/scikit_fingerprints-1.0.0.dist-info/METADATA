## Description

Molecular fingerprints are crucial in various scientific fields, including drug discovery, materials science, and chemical analysis. However, existing Python libraries for computing molecular fingerprints often lack performance, user-friendliness, and support for modern programming standards. This project aims to address these shortcomings by creating an efficient and accessible Python library for molecular fingerprint computation.

## General Project Vision
 
The primary goal of this project is to develop a Python library that simplifies the computation of widely-used molecular fingerprints, such as Morgan's fingerprint, MACCS fingerprint, and others. This library will have the following key features:

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The library will provide an intuitive interface, making it easy to integrate into machine learning workflows.

- **Performance Optimization:** We will implement molecular fingerprint computation algorithms using concurrent programming techniques to maximize performance. Large datasets of molecules will be processed in parallel for improved efficiency.

- **Compatibility:** The library's interface will be inspired by popular data science libraries like Scikit-Learn, ensuring compatibility and familiarity for users familiar with these tools.

- **Extensibility:** Users will be able to customize and extend the library to suit their specific needs.

## Library Description

- The library will offer various functions that accept molecule descriptors (e.g., SMILES) and fingerprint parameters, returning the specified fingerprints.
- It will be open-source and available for installation via pip.
- Automated testing will be implemented to support continuous development and integration.
- The library will be designed for ease of use, minimizing the need for extensive training.
- Compatibility with the standard Python ML stack, based on Scikit-Learn interfaces, will be a top priority.

## Installation

You can install the library using pip:

```bash
pip install skfp
```
