```

## Features
pycalcy contains the following available modules:
- Maths
- Physics
- Geometry
- Astronomy

```python
import pycalcy
```

2. Now you can use the library like this
```python
from pyacalcy import Geometry, App

# Lets create a new geometry object
geometry = Geometry()

# And main app object
pycalcy = App()

# Now we can use it like this to calculate something
volume = pycalcy(geometry.volume, 6, 7)

# Now printing the result
print(volume)
```
