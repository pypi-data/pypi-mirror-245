# Obris CLI
![Obris logo](./assets/images/obris-logo.svg)

The Obris CLI is used to manage Obris apps from the command line. 
It is built using [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/) 
as the underlying cli framework.

## Overview

This project aims to make managing your infrastructure independent from the cloud it's deployed on.  We want developers 
to be able to leverage the tools they need and not have to make compromises when choosing between a scoped, managed 
PaaS offering or a customizable, terse IaaS offering.
