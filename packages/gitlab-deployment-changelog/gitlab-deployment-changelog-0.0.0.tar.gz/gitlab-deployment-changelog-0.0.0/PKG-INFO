# Gitlab Deployment Changelog

Home of this code is now https://github.com/ExB-Group/gitlab-deployment-changelog 

This package grabs the last `n` deployments for a project from gitlab and creates a summary of the merge requests
and their issues. Decoration is done based on scoped labels `type::`. As of now we cover `bug`. Everything else is
considered as a feature. Merge requests without issues, were indicated as well.

## Mandatory setup 

- set gitlab access token `PAT` (https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens)  and `WEBHOOK_URL` for slack

## How to use locally or manually

- checkout
- `pdm install`
- Make sure you have `PROJECT_ID` properly set
- `pdm run changelog <environment>`, the environment is mandatory and could be something like `production/the_exb` 

## Pipeline usage

- call it with the environment name as argument, e.g., `pdm run changelog staging/the_exb`
