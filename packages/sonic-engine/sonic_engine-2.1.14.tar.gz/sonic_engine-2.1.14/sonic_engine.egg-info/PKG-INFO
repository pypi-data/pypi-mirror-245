        | **Hello World** | This template includes a config.yaml file, acting as the orchestrator for Hello World extensions within the Sonic Engine ecosystem. Developers can customize the configuration to specify how the extensions interact and contribute to the overall functionality. The config.yaml file serves as a central hub for managing the collaboration and coordination between different extensions. | [GitHub](https://github.com/AhmedCoolProjects/sonic-engine-template-hello-world) |
        
        ### How to use the template
        
        Clone the template repository:
        
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/AhmedCoolProjects/sonic-engine-template-hello-world.git
        ```
        
        Install Sonic Engine package:
        
        ```bash
        pip install sonic-engine
        ```
        
        Run the template:
        
        ```bash
        python app.py
        ```
        
        You can check the logs in real-time on the terminal or in the `logs` folder in the **reporting extension**

        | **Hello World Feature Extension**   | A tiny extension that uses scapy package to extract packets infos from a pcap file. For now, it's only intended to extract the src_ip and dst_ip from each packet and publish them as a dictionary object to the dedicated redis channel.                                                                                                                                | [GitHub](https://github.com/AhmedCoolProjects/sonic-engine-hello-world-feature)   |
        | **Hello World Inference Extension** | A tiny extension that uses VirusTotal API to request a complete analysis and predictions for src_ip addresses extracted by Hello World Feature Extension. After each response, the extension publish an object includes an id, timestamp, the data, result and the requested url into another redis channel to provide this object for other extensions that may use it. | [GitHub](https://github.com/AhmedCoolProjects/sonic-engine-hello-world-inference) |
        | **Hello World Reporting Extension** | A tiny extension that subscribe a redis channel and log the data in a specific loggin format. The extension write the logs in a log text file logs/log.txt.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [GitHub](https://github.com/AhmedCoolProjects/sonic-engine-hello-world-reporting) |
