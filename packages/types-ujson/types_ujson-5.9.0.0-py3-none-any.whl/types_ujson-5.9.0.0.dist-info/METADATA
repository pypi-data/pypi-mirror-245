## Typing stubs for ujson

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`ujson`](https://github.com/ultrajson/ultrajson) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`ujson`.

This version of `types-ujson` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `ujson==5.9.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/ujson. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `cff2b3db0ca291e153a8bd407f48ac220a381dd8` and was tested
with mypy 1.7.1, pyright 1.1.339, and
pytype 2023.12.8.
