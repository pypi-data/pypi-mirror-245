# AsyncPexelsClient

AsyncPexelsClient is an asynchronous Python client for the Pexels API. It allows you to interact with the Pexels API to search for photos and videos, get details of a specific photo or video, get curated and popular photos, and download a specific photo or video.

## Installation

You can install the AsyncPexelsClient using pip:

```bash
pip install pexels-async-api
```

## Usage
First, import the `AsyncPexelsClient` class from the pexels-async-api module:

```python
from pexels-async-api import AsyncPexelsClient
```

Then, create an instance of the `AsyncPexelsClient` class, passing your Pexels API key as a parameter to the constructor:

```python
client = AsyncPexelsClient("your_api_key")
```

Now, you can use the `client` object to interact with the Pexels API. Here are some examples:

```python
# Search for photos of cats
photos = await client.search_photos("cats", per_page=5, page=1)
print(photos)

# Search for videos of dogs
videos = await client.search_videos("dogs", per_page=5, page=1)
print(videos)

# Get details of a specific photo by its ID
photo = await client.get_photo(123456)  # replace 123456 with the actual photo ID
print(photo)

# Get details of a specific video by its ID
video = await client.get_video(123456)  # replace 123456 with the actual video ID
print(video)

# Get curated photos
curated_photos = await client.get_curated_photos(per_page=5, page=1)
print(curated_photos)

# Get popular photos
popular_photos = await client.get_popular_photos(per_page=5, page=1)
print(popular_photos)

# Download a specific photo by its ID
photo_data = await client.download_photo(123456)  # replace 123456 with the actual photo ID
with open("photo.jpg", "wb") as f:
    f.write(photo_data)

# Download a specific video by its ID
video_data = await client.download_video(123456)  # replace 123456 with the actual video ID
with open("video.mp4", "wb") as f:
    f.write(video_data)
```

Remember to replace `your_api_key` with your actual Pexels API key. Also, replace `123456` with the actual ID of the photo or video you want to get or download.
