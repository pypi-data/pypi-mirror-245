# This is the configuration template for distronode-test Hetzner Cloud integration tests.
#
# You do not need this template if you are:
#
# 1) Running integration tests without using distronode-test.
# 2) Using the automatically provisioned Hetzner Cloud credentials in distronode-test.
#
# If you do not want to use the automatically provisioned temporary Hetzner Cloud credentials,
# fill in the @VAR placeholders below and save this file without the .template extension,
# into the tests/integration directory of the collection you're testing.
# This will cause distronode-test to use the given configuration instead of temporary credentials.
#
# NOTE: Automatic provisioning of Hetzner Cloud credentials requires an distronode-core-ci API key.
