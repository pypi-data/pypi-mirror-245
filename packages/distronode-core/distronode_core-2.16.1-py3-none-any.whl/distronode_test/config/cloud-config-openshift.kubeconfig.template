# This is the configuration template for distronode-test OpenShift integration tests.
#
# You do not need this template if you are:
#
# 1) Running integration tests without using distronode-test.
# 2) Using the automatically provisioned openshift-origin docker container in distronode-test.
#
# If you do not want to use the automatically provided OpenShift container,
# place your kubeconfig file next into the tests/integration directory of the collection you're testing,
# with the same name is this file, but without the .template extension.
# This will cause distronode-test to use the given configuration and not launch the automatically provided container.
#
# It is recommended that you DO NOT use this template unless you cannot use the automatically provided container.
