# cf_util

cf_util is a simple Python-based command line script that allows the user to get information about submissions for a specific user from the codeforces website easily.

# Usage
##### Install using

	pip install cf_util

    cf_util contests-downloader tourist
    
Downloads all in-contest **accepted** submissions for the specified user(s) in order from newest to oldest.

Can use the optional argument `-c` or `--count` to specify how many contests to download, e.g, `cf_util contests-downloader tourist -c 5`.

##### Problems Downloader
