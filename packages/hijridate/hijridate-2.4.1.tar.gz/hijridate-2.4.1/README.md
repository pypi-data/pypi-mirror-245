## Features

- Accurate and verified date conversion.
- Optimized code performance compared to similar packages.
- Intuitive, clean, and easy-to-use interface.
- Most of the methods and formats are similar to those of standard library.
- Multilingual representation of weekday names, months, and calendar era
  notations.
- Easily extendable to support other natural languages.
- Rich comparison between dates.
- Validation of input dates.
- Works on Python 3.8+ with zero dependencies.
- Thoroughly tested with 100% test coverage.

## Limitations

- The date range supported by converter is limited to the period from the
  beginning of 1343 AH (1 August 1924 CE) to the end of 1500 AH (16 November
  2077 CE).
- The conversion is not intended for religious purposes where sighting of the
  lunar crescent at the beginning of Hijri month is still preferred.
