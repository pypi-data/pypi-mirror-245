# This is parcel

Welcome to the official Parcel python package.
Parcel was made to "Properly Package Python Programs".

Unfortonately, the name "parcel" was already used, so the technical name is "parcelfile"

PARCEL stands for:
Python
Aranger with
Renduring
Complex
Element
Leafs

## functions:

def wrap(
type: None,
spacing:true,
**kwargs
) -> str

wrap takes arguments and concatinates them


def box(
file: str
startline: int
endline: int
) -> any

box takes file contents and seperates them from the main file, while creating a new file

### DISCLAIMER:
Parcel is still under construction, so some functions may not work yet.
