Summary: This resource uses AWS Cloud Control API to perform a lookup of a resource of a given type (such as, `AWS::EC2::VPC`) in your AWS account and current region, based on a query you specify.  If only one match is found, this resource returns the primary ID of the resource (in the `AWS::EC2::VPC` example, the VPC ID) and the resource properties, that you can then reference in your template with the `Fn::GetAtt` intrinsic function.  Specify resource type search targets that are supported by Cloud Control API.

# awscommunity-resource-lookup

> AWS CDK [L1 construct](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/constructs.html) and data structures for the [AWS CloudFormation Registry](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry.html) type `AwsCommunity::Resource::Lookup` v1.10.0.

## Description

This resource uses AWS Cloud Control API to perform a lookup of a resource of a given type (such as, `AWS::EC2::VPC`) in your AWS account and current region, based on a query you specify.  If only one match is found, this resource returns the primary ID of the resource (in the `AWS::EC2::VPC` example, the VPC ID) and the resource properties, that you can then reference in your template with the `Fn::GetAtt` intrinsic function.  Specify resource type search targets that are supported by Cloud Control API.

## Usage

In order to use this library, you will need to activate this AWS CloudFormation Registry type in your account. You can do this via the AWS Management Console or using the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) using the following command:

```sh
aws cloudformation activate-type \
  --type-name AwsCommunity::Resource::Lookup \
  --publisher-id c830e97710da0c9954d80ba8df021e5439e7134b \
  --type RESOURCE \
  --execution-role-arn ROLE-ARN
```

Alternatively:

```sh
aws cloudformation activate-type \
  --public-type-arn arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1::type/resource/c830e97710da0c9954d80ba8df021e5439e7134b/AwsCommunity-Resource-Lookup \
  --execution-role-arn ROLE-ARN
```

You can find more information about activating this type in the [AWS CloudFormation documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry-public.html).
