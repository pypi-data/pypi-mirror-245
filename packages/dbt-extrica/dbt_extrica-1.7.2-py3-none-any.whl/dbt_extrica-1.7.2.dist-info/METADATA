## <b>Extrica DBT Adapter </b>
The ```dbt-extrica``` adapter allows users to interact with Trino, a distributed SQL query engine, using dbt. 
This adapter is designed to facilitate the use of dbt for transforming and modeling data in a Trino environment.
#### Features
- **Trino Compatibility:** Compatible with Trino, allowing users to leverage dbt in Trino-based data environments.
- **JWT Authentication:** Utilizes JWT for secure authentication with Trino. The adapter handles the generation of JWT tokens behind the scenes via username and password configured in profiles.yml.

## Description 

### Connecting to Multiple Data Sources
> <b> Challenges in Limited Connectivity </b> <br>
> Default configurations in dbt make it challenging to connect to databases beyond the primary one associated with the project.
> Many organizations deal with diverse data sources, such as Oracle, Snowflake, and others.
> Integrating and transforming data from these varied sources efficiently becomes essential for comprehensive analytics.

### Solution: Leveraging Trino and Catalogs in Extrica
Trino is an advanced query engine that excels in federated queries across multiple data sources. 
Its ability to connect to various databases and process SQL queries at scale makes it an ideal solution for organizations dealing with diverse data sources.

<b>Extrica</b>, built on Trino introduces the concept of catalogs to address the challenge of connecting to multiple data sources seamlessly within dbt.
Each catalog corresponds to a specific data source, enabling a unified approach to managing and transforming data across various systems.
