description = "ISMgas is a python module used to analyze absorption line kinematics of Interstellar Medium gas. The module takes a 1D spectra as an input and extracts key kinematic diagnostics (such as velocity centroid of absorption) by fitting the absorption profile with multiple gaussian profiles. "
