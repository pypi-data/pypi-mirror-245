# MathPy



For information about the language itself,

check out the [documentation](#https://github.com/Bard-Gaming/MathPy/tree/main/Documentation).



## About

MathPy is a Python library that acts as a completely new

programming language.



The goal of this project is to experiment with strings as 

numbers in a high enough base to allow for a multitude of

characters, and to see if this could be a viable alternative

to the classical way of implementing character strings.



For instance, in hexadecimal, the string "baba" would

have a numerical value of 47802.



## Install MathPy

```commandline

pip install mathpy-string

```



## Run files in MathPy

### The Python way

If you wish to run your MathPy files through a Python program,

you can do so by importing the ``run_file()`` function from

the mathpy library, as follows:



```python

from mathpy import run_file



with open("[filepath]", 'rt', encoding='utf-8') as file:

    run_file(file)

```



### The command line way

If you wish to run your MathPy files through the command line,

you can do it as follows:



```commandline

python -m mathpy run [filepath]

```



or, if you wish to access the shell:



```commandline

python -m mathpy shell

```



or simply:



```commandline

python -m mathpy

```
