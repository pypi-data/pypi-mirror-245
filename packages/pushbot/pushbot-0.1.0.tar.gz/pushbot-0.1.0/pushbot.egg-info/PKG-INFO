A Python library that streamlines your repository creation and commits on Github in 2 lines of code. 

#### Features
1. Repository creation
2. Commits to existing repository
3. Automatically Merge conflicts resolved 
4. High-level wrapper

I've built this library to both explore how Github API works and ease my process to create and commit to my Github account. If you're using VS Code editor, it should already be streamlined but for beginners it is not that straightforward. Besides, resolving merge conflicts is another pain that one-might encounter while doing push through git interface (bash). That is why, I have developed this project. 

#### Long-term plan

Developing a total terminal interface through which users can perform almost any operation on Github. 

### Prerequisites

1. GitHub account
2. Github Personal Access Token (Fine-grained version)
3. Python 3.8. X installed

#### How to receive Github Access Token?

**Head to Github Settings and access "DEVELOPER SETTINGS"**

**Now, head to "FINE-GRAINED ACCESS TOKEN"**

![[Pasted image 20231211155524.png]]

**Create a new TOKEN and head-to "REPO ACCESS"**

(turn-on All repo access to enable creation of both public and private repo)

Now, select the following permissions:

1. ![[Pasted image 20231211155912.png]]

(provide both read and write access)

2. ![[Pasted image 20231211155955.png]]

(provide both read and write access)

3. ![[Pasted image 20231211160117.png]]

(provide read and write access both)

**Now create the access token.** After this when you launch an instance of the provided function, it will ask you for your personal access token to perform the repository creation and commits. 

**Note:** Errors might be encountered. Don't bother about them and check the repository in your profile once the commits are done and you should be able to view them. If you encounter any weird errors, raise a Github issue on the repo: https://github.com/sleepingcat4/push-bot/issues

## Privacy and Security

Your personal access token is not stored in our servers. It is locally stored in your RAM and once the function ends running. All the data are cleared.
