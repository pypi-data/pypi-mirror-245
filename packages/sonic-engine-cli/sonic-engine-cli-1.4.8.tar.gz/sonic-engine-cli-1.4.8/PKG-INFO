        ```yaml
        # Path: my_config.yaml
        # Metadata section for general configuration
        metadata:
          # Folder where extensions are stored
          extensions_folder: extensions
        
        # Categories section for grouping extensions
        categories:
          - name: feature
            description: Extensions that extract features from flows
          - name: inference
            description: Extensions that infer information from flows and request predictions
          - name: reporting
            description: Extensions that report the results

              # # Override local configs for a new instance named hello_world_feature_2 _(i.e different description in this case)_
