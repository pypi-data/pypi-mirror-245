# Quos package

Quos package simplifies plotting and simulating a quantum computing circuit employing oscillatory qubits.

### To install

    pip install matplotlib
    pip install pandas
    pip install quos

### To upgrade

    pip install --upgrade quos

### Required packages

- matplotlib
- pandas

### Included def functions in **init**.py file

- Primary (most usable) functions
- qg(ssgqt): To create a plot of a quantum circuit based on a string
- qb(ssgqt): To simulate a quantum circuit and plot Bloch spheres based on a string

- Secondary (occasionally usable) functions
- qh(): To show html file of list of quantum gates included here
- qx(): To download quos.xlsm and qblo.xlsm files
- qs(xlsm='quos.xlsm', wsht='Gates'): To generate a string for a quantum circuit

- Helper (internally used) functions
- qn(nstr, tint=True): To create a number-type string into an integer or a float
- qa(sn0r, sn0i, sn1r, sn1i): To convert qubit state numbers into qubit state angles
- qp(sn0r, sn0i, sn1r, sn1i): To convert qubit state numbers into qubit state probabilities
- qm(xS, sn0r, sn0i, sn1r, sn1i): To multiply a matrix and a vector to generate a vector

### Included gates in plots and simulations

- Qubits
- 0: qubit in state 0
- 1: Qubit in state 1
- Q: Qubit in an arbitrary state specified by two angle arguments

- Individual gates without any argument
- I: Identity
- H: Hadamard
- X: (Pauli) X gate
- Y: (Pauli) Y gate
- Z: (Pauli) Z gate
- S: S (sqrt Z) phase
- T: T (Pi/8 phase gate)
- V: V (sqrt X) phase

- Individual gates with one angle argument
- Rx: Rotation around X
- Ry: Rotation around Y
- Rz: Rotation around Z
- Ph: Global phase gate
- Pp: Phase gate for second state

- Individual gates with three angle arguments
- U: Universal rotation around arbitrary axis

- Interactive gates
- C: Controls another gate: Needs affected gate
- Cd: Reverse-controls another gate: Needs affected gate
- Sw: Swaps with another gate: Needs connected Sw
- iSw: Imaginary swaps with another gate: Needs connected iSw

- Measurement related gates
- M: Measurement gate

These gates can work for qudits after some modifications.
