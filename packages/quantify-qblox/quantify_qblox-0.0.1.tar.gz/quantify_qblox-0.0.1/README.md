# Quantify Qblox

Quantify Qblox is the Qblox hardware backend for Quantify, which is a Python-based data acquisition framework focused on Quantum Computing and solid-state physics experiments.

The framework consists of [quantify-core](https://pypi.org/project/quantify-core/) ([git](https://gitlab.com/quantify-os/quantify-core/) | [docs](https://quantify-os.org/docs/quantify-core/))
and [quantify-scheduler](https://pypi.org/project/quantify-scheduler/) ([git](https://gitlab.com/quantify-os/quantify-scheduler/) | [docs](https://quantify-os.org/docs/quantify-scheduler/)).
It is built on top of [QCoDeS](https://qcodes.github.io/Qcodes/)
and is a spiritual successor of [PycQED](https://github.com/DiCarloLab-Delft/PycQED_py3).
