Outputs
=======

The tool creates several files and folders in the specified output directory.
Below is the list and description of each output generated by the tool.

Outputs
-------

- ``coembedding_emd.tsv``
   This file represents the co-embedding of Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) and image embeddings. The first column contains identifiers (either gene symbols or sample IDs) while the subsequent columns contain embedding values.

- ``muse_latent_x.txt``, ``muse_latent_y.txt``, ``muse_latent.txt``
   These files are outputs of the MuSE algorithm and represent the learned latent embeddings for the given data. The `x`, `y`, and combined latent representations relate to the embeddings for PPIs (`x`), images (`y`), and their co-embedded form.

- ``muse_reconstruct_x.txt``, ``muse_reconstruct_y.txt``
   The reconstructed embeddings after the MuSE training process.

- ``muse.pth``
   The model related to the MuSE co-embedding process. This file allows for future loading and reuse of the model without needing to retrain it.

- ``muse.txt``
   A general output from the MuSE co-embedding algorithm.

Logs and Metadata
-----------------

- ``error.log``:
    Contains error logs generated during the execution of the script.

- ``output.log``:
    A log file detailing the standard messages, warnings, or any information generated during the execution.

- ``ro-crate-metadata.json``:
    Metadata in RO-Crate format, a community effort to establish a lightweight approach to packaging research data with their metadata.

    The main object contains identifier (@id), type (@type), name, descriptions, keywords and isPartOf, that describes the hierarchical relationship (organization and project).

    Graph: The @graph key contains an array of objects that detail other entities related to the main dataset.

    b. Output Files: details of output files generated by the tool.
