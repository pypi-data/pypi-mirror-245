# gfpro-irrigation-control

`gfpro-irrigation-control` contains `gfpro_irrigiation_control`, a Python module that provides Bluetooth-LE-based control of the [GFPRO Eco irrigation valve](https://gfgarden.it/en/products/programmatore-d-irrigazione-gfpro-eco-watering-computer-bluetooth%C2%AE-1). It supports reading and toggling the valve status, as well as checking the battery status.

The package also includes two command line interfaces that interact with the module: one for manual control of valves and another for integrating valves into automated systems through MQTT.
