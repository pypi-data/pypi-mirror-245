    A class for representing a neural network with a given genome and neural

    Attributes:

    weights: contains weights of the neural network.

    the neural network, where each integer represents the number of neurons in
    that layer.

        Initialize a neural network object with the given weight and neural
        structure.

        weights: An one-dimensional Numpy Array containing the weights for
        the neural network.

        A numpy ndarray with the output values of the neural network

        Note:
        -----
        This method runs the neural network with the given input values using
        the current weights and neural structure of the neural network. It
        initializes a new empty neural network and fills in the values using
        the provided input and the weights. The weights are then applied to the
        corresponding input neuron to obtain the output of the next neuron in
        the network. The output of each layer is passed through the activation
        function (tanh) and stored in the neural network list. Finally, the
        output of the last layer is returned as a Numpy Array.
