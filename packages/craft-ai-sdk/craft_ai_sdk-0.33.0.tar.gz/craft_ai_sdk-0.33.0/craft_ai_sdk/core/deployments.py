    """Create a custom deployment associated to a given pipeline.

    Args:
        pipeline_name (:obj:`str`): Name of the pipeline.
        deployment_name (:obj:`str`): Name of the deployment.
        execution_rule(:obj:`str`): Execution rule of the deployment. Must
            be "endpoint" or "periodic". For convenience, members of the enumeration
            :class:`DEPLOYMENT_EXECUTION_RULES` could be used too.
        schedule (:obj:`str`, optional): Schedule of the deployment. Only
            required if ``execution_rule`` is "periodic". Must be a valid
            `cron expression <https://www.npmjs.com/package/croner>`.
            The deployment will be executed periodically according to this schedule.
            The schedule must follow this format:
            ``<minute> <hour> <day of month> <month> <day of week>``.
            Note that the schedule is in UTC time zone.
            '*' means all possible values.
            Here are some examples:

                * ``"0 0 * * *"`` will execute the deployment every day at
                  midnight.
                * ``"0 0 5 * *"`` will execute the deployment every 5th day of
                  the month at midnight.

        inputs_mapping(:obj:`list` of instances of :class:`InputSource`):
            List of input mappings, to map pipeline inputs to different
            sources (such as constant values, endpoint inputs, or environment
            variables). See :class:`InputSource` for more details.
            For endpoint rules, if an input of the step in the pipeline is not
            explicitly mapped, it will be automatically mapped to an endpoint
            input with the same name.
            For periodic rules, all inputs of the step in the pipeline must be
            explicitly mapped.
        outputs_mapping(:obj:`list` of instances of :class:`OutputDestination`):
            List of output mappings, to map pipeline outputs to different
            destinations. See :class:`OutputDestination` for more details.
            For endpoint rules, if an output of the step in the pipeline is not
            explicitly mapped, it will be automatically mapped to an endpoint
            output with the same name.
            For periodic rules, all outputs of the step in the pipeline must be
            explicitly mapped.
        description (:obj:`str`, optional): Description of the deployment.

          trigger the deployment. Note that this token is only returned if
          ``execution_rule`` is "endpoint".

          this schedule is only returned if ``execution_rule`` is "periodic".
        * ``"human_readable_schedule"`` (:obj:`str`): Human readable schedule
          of the deployment. Note that this schedule is only returned if
