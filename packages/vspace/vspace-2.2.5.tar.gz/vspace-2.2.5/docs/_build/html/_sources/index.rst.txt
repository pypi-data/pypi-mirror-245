VSPACE Documentation
====================
``VSPACE`` is a tool to build input files for a parameter sweep with ``VPLanet``.

With ``VSPACE`` you can quickly and easily build input files with specific
parameters with a specific type of distribution. In **Grid Mode** you can build
input files in which the initial conditions have regular spacings within specified
limits and with either linear or logarithmic spacings. In **Random Mode** the
distributions are random, but can be **uniform, Gaussian** or uniform in **sine**
or **cosine**. Non-uniform distributions can be easily truncated, if necessary.
Histograms of the initial conditions will also be built. After generating the
trials, use the `multi-planet <../multi-planet>`_ script to run.
