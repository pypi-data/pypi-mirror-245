A Pytest plugin for test-case prioritization.

This `pytest`_ plugin allows you to find failures faster and receive sooner debugging feedback from CI.
It does so by prioritizing running tests that have shorter execution time and/or recently failed.


Installation
============

To install "pytest-tcp" via `pip`_ from `PyPI`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pytest-tcp


Usage
=====

Pytest will automatically find the plugin and use it when you run ``pytest``.
You can use the default prioritization heuristic,
which runs tests that have shorter execution time first
by passing the ``--tcp`` option:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest --tcp

The terminal output will tell you the current configurations
and runtime overhead of this plugin::

    Using TCP weights 1-0
    Collect TCP features took 0.0029001235961914062s.
    Compute TCP order took 0.0002548694610595703s.

You can configure the weights of different prioritization heuristics
by additionally passing the ```--tcp-weight`` flag with formatted values:

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest --tcp --tcp-weight=0-1


Weights are separated by hyphens ``-``.
The 1st weight is for running faster tests,
the 2nd weight is for running recently failed tests.
The sum of all weights must equal to 1.
A higher weight means that a corresponding heuristic is favored.
The default value is ``1-0``, meaning it entirely favors running faster tests.


You can make these options always apply by adding them to the ``addopts`` setting in your
`pytest.ini <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference/customize.html#configuration>`_:

.. code-block:: ini

    [pytest]
    addopts = --tcp --tcp-weight=0.5-0.5


Contributing
============

Contributions are very welcome. Tests can be run with `tox`_.
