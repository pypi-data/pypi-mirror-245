# mim_solvers
Implementation of numerical solvers used in the Machines in Motion Laboratory. 
In particular, the Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) solver described in [this paper](https://laas.hal.science/hal-04330251) solves nonlinear constrained OCPs efficiently.

All solvers are implemented by using [Crocoddyl](https://github.com/loco-3d/crocoddyl/tree/devel) (v2.0) as the base software. 
Consequently, Crocoddyl users can use our efficient solvers while constructing their OCPs using the same API they are used to. 
The default solvers of Crocoddyl are also re-implemented for benchmarking purposes (namely DDP and FDDP) but with modified termination criteria and line-search.

Examples on how to use the solvers can be found in the `examples` directory.
