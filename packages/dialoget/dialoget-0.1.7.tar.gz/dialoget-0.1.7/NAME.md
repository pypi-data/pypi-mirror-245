## dialoget 

The project has a focus on natural language processing, making code read more like a conversation.
**dialoget** sounds unique and is somewhat suggestive of dialogue, 
which could relate to defining functions as sentences.
Using decorators to define functions as sentencesâ€”should be strongly considered. 
Based on that, **dialoget** might resonate most closely with 
the idea of translating code into more human-understandable dialogue, 
as **DecorApiSentence** or **FuncDialogDecorator** 

## Another names:

**testfunc**: 
Implies a focus on testing functions. If your project's main goal is to define functions for testing purposes, this name could be suitable. However, it might not fully convey the idea of using decorators or defining functions as sentences.

**apitee**: 
Suggests a connection to APIs or being a part of an API. If your project is designed to integrate functions into an API or facilitate API development, it could be appropriate. However, it might be too general and not immediately suggest the usage of decorators or natural language.

**nfunc**: 
This is short and potentially memorable but also quite vague. The "n" could stand for "new," but it doesn't explicitly relate to the concept of decorators or sentence-like function definitions.

**letfunc**:
This name is simple, but it doesn't communicate much about the project's purpose. It implies allowing or enabling functions but doesn't capture the decorator or sentence-like definition aspect.

**metamodule**: 
This name suggests a module that deals with meta-programming or extends functionality, which could fit well if your project is about using decorators to enhance functions. However, it doesn't specifically imply the use of natural language.

**apiunit**: 
This name implies a focus on API components or units, potentially hinting at modularity and testability. If your project emphasizes organizing API endpoints and testing them, it could be a good fit. Nonetheless, like some of the other names, it doesn't directly suggest the use of sentence-like definitions through decorators.
