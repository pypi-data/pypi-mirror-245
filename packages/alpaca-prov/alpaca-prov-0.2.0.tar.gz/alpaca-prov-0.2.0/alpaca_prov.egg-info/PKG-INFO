## Automated Lightweight Provenance Capture

[![tests](https://github.com/INM-6/alpaca/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/INM-6/alpaca/actions/workflows/CI.yml)
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/alpaca-prov/badge/?version=latest)](https://alpaca-prov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Alpaca is a Python package for the capture of provenance information during the
execution of Python scripts that process data.

Alpaca provides a simple API for recording the details of the functions being
executed, the data flow, and a description of parameters used.
This is accomplished with minimal code instrumentation and user intervention.

Provenance information is structured and serialized according to a model
based on the [W3C PROV format](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview).
