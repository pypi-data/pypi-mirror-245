# auto_fchp

Return the high-pass corner frequency value that stabilizes the displacement of a ground motion record.

    The high-pass corner frequency, fchp, is selected to satisfy two objectives:
        1. A polynomial is fit to the filtered displacement record, and the amplitude of the polynomial fit
        divided by the amplitude of the filtered displacement record is within a tolerance of a specified target.
        2. The amplitude of the initial portion of the displacement record before the p-wave arrival divided by
        the amplitude of the filtered displacement record is within a tolerance of a specified target.

    The value of fchp is computed numerically using the Scipy package optimize.ridder(). Two initial values
    of fchp are provided that bracket the root, and the Scipy package solves for the root that minimizes the
    objective function. The tolerance is on the value of fchp (i.e., xtol in optimize.ridder)

    A value of fchp is obtained first to satisfy objective 1. Objective 2 is optional, and if it is applied,
    the value of fchp from objective 1 is checked against objective 2. If the residual from objective 2 is
    less than or equal to zero, fchp is set equal to the value from objective 1. Otherwise, iterations are
    performed to satisfy objective 2.
