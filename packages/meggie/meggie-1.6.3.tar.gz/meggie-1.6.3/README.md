## Debugging

* If command *meggie* is not found, you should ensure that you are in the correct python environment.
* If the command is found, but the software crashes during startup to an *ImportError*, you should ensure that you are using *Python 3* and that the dependencies are installed. Individual missing dependencies can often be installed with either *conda install* or *pip install*.
* If the software crashes during analysis or startup, and the terminal window does not show you the stacktrace, you can start meggie using command *meggie debug* and then the next crash will come with a stacktrace.
