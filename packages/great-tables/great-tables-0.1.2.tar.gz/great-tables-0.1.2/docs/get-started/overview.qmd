## Adding parts to this simple table

The **great_tables** (or just **gt**) package makes it relatively easy to add parts so that the resulting **gt Table** better conveys the information you want to present. These table parts work well together and there the possible variations in arrangement can handle most tabular presentation needs. The previous **gt Table** demonstrated had only two parts, the **Column Labels** and the **Table Body**. The next few examples will show all of the other table parts that are available.

This is the way the main parts of a table (and their subparts) fit together:

The parts (roughly from top to bottom) are:

- the **Table Header** (optional; with a **title** and possibly a **subtitle**)
- the **Stub** and the **Stub Head** (optional; contains *row labels*, optionally within *row groups* having *row group labels* and possibly *summary labels* when a summary is present)
- the **Column Labels** (contains *column labels*, optionally under *spanner column labels*)
- the **Table Body** (contains *columns* and *rows* of *cells*)
- the **Table Footer** (optional; possibly with **footnotes** and **source notes**)
