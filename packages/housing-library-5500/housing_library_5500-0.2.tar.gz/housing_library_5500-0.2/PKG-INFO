#This Submission consists of soulutions for Tamlep-Assignment-2.1

# Median housing value prediction

The housing data can be downloaded from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ageron/handson-ml/master/. The script has codes to download the data. We have modelled the median house value on given housing data. 

The following techniques have been used: 

 - Linear regression
 - Decision Tree
 - Random Forest

## Steps performed
 - We prepare and clean the data. We check and impute for missing values.
 - Features are generated and the variables are checked for correlation.
 - Multiple sampling techinuqies are evaluated. The data set is split into train and test.
 - All the above said modelling techniques are tried and evaluated. The final metric used to evaluate is mean squared error.

## To excute the script
Steps to reproduce:
1. ``` unzip dist/housing_library_5500-0.1-py3-none-any.whl -d wheel_contents```
2. ``` cd wheel_contents```
3. ``` python3 house_price_prediction/score.py ```

## To activate the environment
```conda activate <environment-name>```

## To export the environment
```conda env export > environment.yml```

## To import the environment
``` conda env create -f environment.yml```
