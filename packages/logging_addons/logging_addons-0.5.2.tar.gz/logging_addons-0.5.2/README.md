Why any alternative or add-on to the standard logging lib?

While the std lib provides the essential need, there are situations where you do not get what you might expect. Or, the more you use logging, the more you want to get rid of some boiler-plate.

This package provides e.g. an alternative log propagation along the logger tree, or an easy way to define filters in the config.
