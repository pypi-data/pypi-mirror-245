# PreDoCS: Preliminary Design of Composite Structures

PreDoCS (Preliminary Design of Composite Structures) is Python tool for a fast evaluation of
wing structure concepts i.e. for a multi-disciplinary design optimization.


## Install PreDoCS

Create an [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) environment:

    conda create -n predocs python=3.9
    conda activate predocs


Install the OpenCASCADE dependency (only available with conda)

    conda install -c dlr-sc pythonocc-core


To install PreDoCS, use pip:

    pip install predocs


### Additional dependencies

For the export of the cross sections for [BECAS](https://becas.dtu.dk/)
(`PreDoCS.CrossSectionAnalysis.Export.generate_BECAS_input`), the
[BECAS shellexpander](https://becas.dtu.dk/software/pre-and-post-processors/shellexpander)
must be installed.


## Quickstart

For a quickstart example, take a look at the [PreDoCS examples](https://gitlab.com/dlr-sy/predocs/-/jobs/artifacts/master/browse/examples?job=examples_standalone).
